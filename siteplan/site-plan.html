    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p> 
      <b>24/7 Business Accessibility: </b>
      years past, companies could get away with being less than fully accessible. That won't work in today's
        digitally-driven, highly connected culture. Most customers expect the businesses they patronize to be
        accessible, always.
        In order to compete at the highest level, our real estate company makes accessibility an absolute priority. With that
        in mind, 
    </p>
    <p> 
      <b>Services Promotion: </b>
      Ultimately the purpose of any promotional effort is to sell the service product through informing, 
      persuading and reminding. Clearly these general objectives vary according to the nature of each service 
      industry and service product. As a real estate company we will create awareness of the firm’s service among potential users; 
      Generate detailed knowledge of the firm’s product and service including details of cost- benefit relationship, price and other 
      pertinent information and advise existing and potential customers of special offers or modifications.
    </p>
    <p> 
      <b>Business Growth: </b>
      Growth is crucial to the long-term survival of a business. It helps to acquire assets, attract new talent and fund investments. 
      It also drives business performance and profit. we plan to allow our company take advantage of new opportunities, expand our 
      products or services, attract more customers, increase sales and employ more staff.
      This will also help us to respond to market demand, increase our market share and capitalise on our growing brand to boost business
      credibility and greater market dominance
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p><b>First-Time Buyers: </b>These are our potential house buyers who has not previously owned a property.</p>

      already own: Although Tax credit for move-up buyers will be less than for first-time buyers, but still significant.</p>

    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      In this digital era, an engaging and intuitive website design is
      the utmost requirement for any business looking to stay ahead of
      the curve. If you are a real estate agent and still working on
      referrals, cold calls and run-of-the-mill methods, now is the
      time to create a website design for your real estate business.

    <h3>Buy</h3>
    <p>
      Technology has forever changed the way people buy homes. According
      to a study conducted by the National Association of Realtors,
      approximately 42% of home buyers conducted an online search when
      they were looking for available properties for sale, while only 17%
      contacted a realtor. Therefore, having a strong online presence is
      viable for your real estate agency to reach prospective buyers and
      boost your impact in a highly cut-throat industry.

    <h3>Promotions</h3>
    <p>
      A website serves as an online medium that can effectively advertise
      your services, mission, vision and brand story that is essential to
      educating your potential customers. A well-designed real estate
      website helps you display your list of properties and services
      and allows you to reach targeted customers. They can search for
      local listings that your website offers and easily find their
      dream home without breaking a sweat.
